# Objects Review Note

\*\* warning:
These notes are simplified to help grasp the big concepts. Some corners are cut or informal definitions are used -- great for learning but may not 100% align with formal definitions.

## Objects

- Objects are a collection of variables and functions
- Objects represent he attributes and behavior of something used in a program
- Object variables are called properties and object functions are called methods
- Objects store "keyed" collections

## Four Pillars

### Encapsulation

- The process of storing functions (methods) with their associated data(properties) - into one thing (fusing of data and functionality into one, object)\*\*

- Why? Encapsulation help us do
  -- we can make the already written code more readable and changeable(less prone to mistakes).

- Is it easy to add new features and functionality?
  -- yes. if something is broken/or sucks, you can just fix what's broken.
  -- Complex or unnecessary details are hidden -> this enables you to implement things without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity. --> Breaking down the code to smaller mode manageable pieces of code. Do Stuff Once.

### Abstraction

- Hide details and show essentials
- Simple, Predictable, Manageable

- Why?
  -- Handle smaller more manageable pieces of code without breaking other things
  -- helps to split the complexity of the app/project into manageable parts.

### Inheritance

- Make a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods.

### Polymorphism

- Code written to use an interface automatically knows how to work with any number of different objects that provide the interface.
  -- Helps you avoid fi/else and switch cases
  -- Makes your code more usable
  -- Supports the other pillars
